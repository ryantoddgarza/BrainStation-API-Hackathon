# donyewump.app

**Donye Wump**, n. <br>
**1.** An entity whose combined grandioseness of Donald Trump and Kanye West make said entity irresistibly hilarious.

## What is it?

Born out of a five hour API based hackathon, [donyewump.app](https://donyewump.app) is an absurdist web application that serves a user local weather data and some "inspirational" words by the unlikely pairing of Donald Trump and Kanye West.

The app leverages Geolocation, OpenWeatherMap, Kanye.Rest, and TronaldDump APIs.
